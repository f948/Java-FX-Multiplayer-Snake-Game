# JavaFX-Multiplayer-Snake-Game

Description-A clone of the 1997 game Snake in which a player controlled a snake that had to eat a randomly appearing piece of food to keep growing larger.If the snake's head hit a screen border or itself the game would reset.I also designed a multiplayer version available to play for 2-3 players. If there is more than one player snakes can lose all their body parts if their heads crash into another player's body.

# How to play 

Use WASD keys to control the green snake
Use TFGH keys to control the blue snake
Use IJKL keys to control the yellow snake 

Move your snake's head to the randomly appearing red squares to eat them and grow your snake
If your snake hits its own body it will lose its body parts and only the head will remain
This will also happen if your snake hits the edge of the screen 
In multiplayer your snake could lose its entire body if its head hits another players' body
Also in multiplayer when two snake heads hit each other the longer one will lose its entire body
If two heads collide and the snakes are the same size the snake that loses its entire body will be chosen at random
